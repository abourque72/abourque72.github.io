	<p style = "text-align:left">The course description is "This course is about three interesting geometric objects that are important in representation theory. We will discuss the geometry of Springer fibers, affine Springer fibers and Hitchin fibers. We will then construct representations of Weyl groups and their affine version. An interesting aspect of these representations is that these do not arise from actions on such fibers but on the cohomology of these fibers. In the last part of the course, we will discuss the relation of the affine Springer fibers with the Hitchin fibers. A review of background material will be given as needed."</p>
