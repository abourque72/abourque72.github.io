	<p style = "text-align:left">The course description is "Modular forms appear naturally in connection with problems arising in many areas and play a central role in the development of number theory. One of the reasons is because they have very tight connections with elliptic curves and Galois representations. All the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves, modular forms, and Galois representations are extremely important in Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.</p>
	<p style = "text-align:left">The aim of this course is to cover the classical theory of modular forms. The course will begin with basic definitions and examples. In the later part of the semester, we will discuss some applications, advanced topics, and open problems, depending on students' interest."</p>
