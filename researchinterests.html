		<p style="text-align:left">I used to study mathematical physics with <a href = "https://math.lsu.edu/~zeitlin">Anton Zeitlin</a>. See our paper "Flat GL(1|1)-connections and fatgraphs" <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08033">here</a>. This paper was published to the Journal of Geometry of Physics, Volume 191.</p>

		<p style="text-align:left">I am currently working with <a href = "https://math.lsu.edu/~pramod">Pramod Achar</a> to give an explicit description of global Schubert varieties for GL(n), using lattices. So far, we have a description for global Schubert varieties indexed miniscule coweights. The work can be extended in several ways: getting similar results for all dominant coweights, not just miniscule ones; using our descriptions to understand resolutions of singularities of global Schubert varieties; extending our results to other groups. There is also a family of open subsets of the special fiber of global Schubert varieties (at least in the miniscule case). I would like to show that they have nice properties, both intrinsic and in relation to the stratification by orbits. </p>

		<p style="text-align:left">My broad interests are in algebraic geometry, representation theory, and number theory. I also would like to explore interest in homotopy theory and algebraic K theory.</p>
