		<p style="text-align:left">I used to study mathematical physics with <a href = "https://math.lsu.edu/~zeitlin">Anton Zeitlin</a>. See our paper "Flat GL(1|1)-connections and fatgraphs" <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08033">here</a>. This paper was published to the Journal of Geometry of Physics, Volume 191.</p>

		<p style="text-align:left">I am currently working with 
			<a href = "https://math.lsu.edu/~pramod">Pramod Achar</a> 
			to give an explicit description of global Schubert varieties for GL(n) 
			in terms of lattices. Paper coming soon! Future work includes:
			using our descriptions to understand resolutions of singularities of 
			global Schubert varieties, and extending our results to other groups, 
			especially SL(n). There is also a family of open subsets of the 
			special fiber of global Schubert varieties (at least in certain cases). 
			I would like to show that they have nice properties, both intrinsic 
			and in relation to the stratification by orbits. </p>

		<p style="text-align:left">My broad interests are in algebraic geometry, representation theory, and number theory. I also would like to explore homotopy theory and algebraic K-theory. </p>

		<p style="text-align:left">I have become particularly fond of perverse sheaves, thanks to Pramod. I wrote a lot about them on my blog. </p>
