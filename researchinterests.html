		<p style="text-align:left">I used to study mathematical physics with <a href = "https://math.lsu.edu/~zeitlin">Anton Zeitlin</a>. See our paper "Flat GL(1|1)-connections and fatgraphs" <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08033">here</a>. This paper was published to the Journal of Geometry of Physics, Volume 191.</p>

		<p style="text-align:left">I also previously worked with 
			<a href = "https://math.lsu.edu/~pramod">Pramod Achar</a> 
			to give an explicit description of global Schubert varieties for GL(n) 
			in terms of lattices. See our paper "On global Schubert varieties for the general linear group" 
			<a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2412.01962">here</a>. </p>

		<p style="text-align:left">My broad interests are in algebraic geometry, representation theory, and number theory. I also would like to explore homotopy theory and algebraic K-theory. </p>

		<p style="text-align:left">I have become particularly fond of perverse sheaves, thanks to Pramod. I wrote a lot about them on my blog. </p>
